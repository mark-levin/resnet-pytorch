# resnet-pytorch
## Overview
This project features an implementation of ResNet models (ResNet18, 34, 50, 101, 152) in PyTorch. The ResNet50 model was run on the CIFAR-10 dataset, achieving 94.85% accuracy.

## To-Do
- Implement a train/val split to optimize the learning rate scheduler
- Test and adapt the model for the ImageNet dataset
